# Observability Stack Implementation: Step-by-Step Solution

## Problem Statement
Deploy a complete observability stack on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) that integrates metrics, logs, and traces with Grafana Cloud, then build a dashboard to visualize system health.

---

## Step 1: Setting Up Google Cloud Infrastructure

**My Prompt:** "I need to set up a GKE cluster for hosting an observability stack"

I used GKE Autopilot (auto-scales nodes, prevents idle costs) and created a dedicated `monitoring` namespace:

```bash
gcloud container clusters create-auto observability-demo --region=us-central1
gcloud container clusters get-credentials observability-demo --region=us-central1
kubectl create namespace monitoring
```

Verified with `kubectl get nodes` showing 3 nodes in Ready state.

---

## Step 2: Linking Grafana Cloud APIs

**My Prompt:** "I need to connect Kubernetes to Grafana Cloud to send metrics, logs, and traces"

Using Comet AI Browser, I navigated Grafana Cloud UI and extracted three API endpoints:

- **Prometheus (Metrics):** `https://prometheus-prod-01-prod-us-west-0.grafana.net/api/prom/push`
- **Loki (Logs):** `https://logs-prod-us-west-0.grafana.net/loki/api/v1/push`
- **Tempo (Traces):** `https://tempo-prod-01-prod-us-west-0.grafana.net:443`
- **API Token:** `glc_eyJvIjoiMTU1MzEwMiIsIm4iOi...`

**My Follow-up:** "How do I securely store these credentials in Kubernetes?"

Stored in Kubernetes Secret (allows credential rotation without rebuilding containers):

```bash
kubectl create secret generic grafana-cloud-credentials \
  --from-literal=api-token="glc_..." \
  --from-literal=prometheus-url="https://..." \
  --namespace=monitoring
```

**Key learning:** Secrets are encrypted at rest and mounted as environment variables at runtime.

---

## Step 3: Deploying Grafana Alloy

**My Prompt:** "I need one agent for metrics, logs, and traces instead of three separate agents"

Grafana Alloy replaces Prometheus agent, Promtail, and Tempo agent with unified pipelines.

### RBAC Setup

**My Prompt:** "Alloy needs to auto-discover Kubernetes pods—how do I give it API access?"

Created ServiceAccount with ClusterRole permissions. Critical insight: `watch` verb enables real-time pod discovery without polling.

```yaml
# Pattern: ServiceAccount → ClusterRole (get, list, watch on pods) → ClusterRoleBinding
```

### Alloy Configuration

**My Prompt:** "Configure Alloy to scrape pods, collect logs, and receive traces"

Three pipelines:

**Metrics:** `discovery.kubernetes → prometheus.scrape → prometheus.remote_write → Grafana Cloud`

**Logs:** `discovery.kubernetes → loki.source.kubernetes → loki.write → Grafana Cloud`

**Traces:** `otelcol.receiver.otlp (ports 4317/4318) → otelcol.exporter.otlp → Grafana Cloud`

Verification: `kubectl logs -n monitoring -l app=grafana-alloy` showed `"remote write succeeded"` and `"loki push succeeded status=204"`.

---

## Step 4: Generating Traces

**My Prompt:** "I need to generate OpenTelemetry traces to test Tempo"

Deployed telemetrygen:
```yaml
Args: traces --otlp-endpoint=grafana-alloy.monitoring.svc.cluster.local:4317 --traces=2 --rate=1
```
Generates 2 traces/second continuously, sent via OTLP gRPC to Alloy.

---

## Step 5: Traffic Generation with Cost Control

**My Critical Prompt:** "Make sure the traffic generator stops so I am not charged a crazy amount!!!"

Created time-bounded workload using Unix timestamp arithmetic:

```bash
END_TIME=$(($(date +%s) + 1800))  # 30 minutes

while [ $(date +%s) -lt $END_TIME ]; do
  # 90% success requests
  for i in $(seq 1 9); do curl -s http://service:9090/metrics > /dev/null; done
  # 10% error requests
  curl -s http://service:9090/nonexistent > /dev/null
done

echo "Traffic generation complete! Total requests: $REQUEST_COUNT"
sleep infinity  # Keep pod alive for log inspection
```

**Result:** 1,740 requests, $0.006 cost.

---

## Step 6: Discovering the Pipeline Delay

**Problem:** Grafana Cloud panels showed "No Data" after deployment.

**My Troubleshooting:**
1. `kubectl get pods` → All Running ✅
2. `curl http://localhost:12345/metrics` → Data exists locally ✅
3. `kubectl logs` → No errors ✅
4. Waited 10 minutes → Data appeared ✅

**Root cause:** 5-10 minute delay from WAL batching + remote write intervals + Grafana Cloud ingestion.

**Key learning:** "No Data" doesn't mean broken—it means wait longer.

---

## Step 7: Building the Distributed Tracing Dashboard

**My Prompts:**
- "Show CPU usage per pod"
- "Filter logs for errors and warnings"
- "Calculate P99 latency for DNS"
- "Track goroutines over time"
- "Show trace span duration by service"

**Solution:** I used **Grafana's built-in AI agent** to generate all 18 queries. It understood my specific metric names (`alloy_resources_cpu_seconds_total`, `coredns_dns_requests_total`) and suggested appropriate aggregations (`sum`, `rate`, `histogram_quantile`).

### The 18 Dashboard Panels (Generated by Grafana AI)

**Time Range:** Last 24 hours (configurable via time picker)

**1. HTTP Request Rate** (METRICS)
- Formula: `sum(rate(prometheus_http_requests_total[5m]))`
- Measures: Requests per second. Baseline traffic indicator - spike to 0.016 req/s shows traffic generation.

**User Story:** As an SRE at Ensemble, I want to monitor the HTTP request rate, so that I can validate our capacity planning and auto-scale our resources before peak traffic hits, preventing a repeat of the Black Friday outage.

---

**2. HTTP P95 Latency** (METRICS)
- Formula: `histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le))`
- Measures: 95th percentile response time. Flat at ~5ms confirms excellent performance.

**User Story:** As a Web Team Lead at Ensemble, I want to track P95 latency on our product and checkout pages, so that I can ensure a fast user experience and reduce cart abandonment.

---

**3. Log Volume Rate** (LOGS)
- Formula: `sum(rate({namespace="monitoring"} [1m]))`
- Measures: Total logs per second. Spikes to ~30 logs/s show burst activity patterns.

**User Story:** As a DevOps Engineer at Ensemble, I want to see the log volume rate, so that I can spot unusual spikes that often indicate a system-wide failure or a DDoS attack.

---

**4. Logs by Pod** (LOGS)
- Formula: `sum(rate({namespace="monitoring"} [1m])) by (pod)`
- Measures: Which pods are logging most. Multi-colored lines show GKE system pods (gmp-operator, cilium-agent).

**User Story:** As an SRE at Ensemble, I want to filter logs by pod, so that when an issue arises, I can immediately isolate the problem to a specific service instead of searching through millions of unrelated logs from Splunk.

---

**5. Trace Rate** (TRACES)
- Formula: `rate({} [5m])`
- Measures: Traces per second. Consistent 2 traces/s after 16:00 confirms telemetrygen is running.

**User Story:** As an SRE at Ensemble, I want to see the overall trace rate, so that I can confirm that all our services are correctly instrumented and we have full visibility across our distributed system.

---

**6. Span Count Over Time** (TRACES)
- Formula: `{} | count_over_time`
- Measures: Total spans generated. Jump to ~700 at 16:00 shows when trace generation started.

**User Story:** As a Back-End Developer at Ensemble, I want to see the span count over time, so that I can identify if a new deployment has introduced unnecessary complexity or redundant service calls.

---

**7. Error Log Rate** (LOGS)
- Formula: `sum(rate({namespace="monitoring"} |~ "(?i)error|fail|exception" [1m]))`
- Measures: Errors logged per second. Spikes to 0.15 logs/s indicate occasional failures.

**User Story:** As a Product Manager at Ensemble, I want to see the error log rate in a simple graph, so that I can understand the business impact of technical issues and prioritize fixes.

---

**8. Warning Log Rate** (LOGS)
- Formula: `sum(rate({namespace="monitoring"} |~ "(?i)warn" [1m]))`
- Measures: Warnings logged per second. Spikes to 3 logs/s show periodic warning bursts.

**User Story:** As a Developer at Ensemble, I want to monitor the warning log rate, so that I can address potential issues proactively before they escalate into critical, customer-facing errors.

---

**9. Average Span Duration** (TRACES)
- Formula: `{} | select(duration) | avg_over_time`
- Measures: Mean trace latency. Flat at ~0.0001 ns (microseconds) shows consistent performance.

**User Story:** As a DevOps Engineer at Ensemble, I want to see the average duration of our service calls (spans), so that I can establish performance baselines and get alerted when services start to degrade.

---

**10. P99 Span Duration** (TRACES)
- Formula: `{} | quantile(0.99, duration)`
- Measures: Worst-case trace latency. Flat at ~0.000125 ns confirms no slow outliers.

**User Story:** As an SRE at Ensemble, I want to focus on P99 span duration, so that I can find and fix the worst-performing transactions that are causing a terrible experience for some of our customers.

---

**11. CPU Usage** (METRICS)
- Formula: `sum(rate(alloy_resources_cpu_seconds_total[5m])) by (instance)`
- Measures: Per-pod CPU percentage. Grid of 27 gauges all green (0.5-0.8%) shows efficient resource usage.

**User Story:** As a DevOps Engineer at Ensemble, I want to see CPU usage across all our pods, so that I can identify overloaded services that might be the root cause of application slowness.

---

**12. Memory Usage** (METRICS)
- Formula: `sum(alloy_resources_memory_bytes) by (instance) / 1024 / 1024`
- Measures: Per-pod memory in MiB. Grid shows stable 146-230 MiB range, no leaks detected.

**User Story:** As an SRE at Ensemble, I want to monitor memory usage for memory leaks, so that I can prevent service crashes that take down the entire website.

---

**13. Error Count by Pod** (LOGS)
- Formula: `sum(count_over_time({namespace="monitoring"} |~ "(?i)error" [5m])) by (pod)`
- Measures: Which pods generate most errors. Bar chart shows spike to 15 errors for collector pods.

**User Story:** As a Web Team Lead at Ensemble, I want to see the error count broken down by pod, so that I can instantly see if the checkout-service pod is failing and direct my team to the right place.

---

**14. Recent Errors & Warnings** (LOGS)
- Formula: `{namespace="monitoring"} |~ "(?i)error|warn" | line_format "{{.timestamp}} {{.level}} {{.msg}}"`
- Measures: Actual error text for debugging. Shows "v1 Endpoints deprecated in v1.33+" warning.

**User Story:** As an On-Call Engineer at Ensemble, I want to see a live feed of recent errors and warnings in one place, so that I have immediate context when an alert fires, reducing our mean time to resolution (MTTR).

---

**15. Spans by Name** (TRACES)
- Formula: `{} | count() by (name)`
- Measures: Trace volume by operation. Spike to 700 shows telemetrygen operations.

**User Story:** As a Developer at Ensemble, I want to group spans by their name (e.g., HTTP POST /checkout), so that I can quickly analyze the performance of a specific business transaction from end to end.

---

**16. Duration by Peer Service** (TRACES)
- Formula: `{} | select(duration) | by(peer.service)`
- Measures: Service-to-service latency. Yellow line (telemetrygen-server) at ~0.0001 ns shows fast calls.

**User Story:** As a Web Team Lead at Ensemble, I want to see the duration by peer service, so that I can finally prove whether the checkout failure is our application's fault or due to the slow, third-party payment processor, all from a single dashboard.

---

**17. Active Goroutines** (METRICS)
- Formula: `go_goroutines`
- Measures: Go concurrency count. Steps from 500 → 1,250 → spike to 1,500 during load.

**User Story:** As a Back-End Developer at Ensemble, I want to view active goroutines, so that I can ensure our application is running efficiently and not getting stuck on concurrent processes during high-traffic events.

---

**18. OS Threads** (METRICS)
- Formula: `go_threads`
- Measures: Operating system threads. Steps from 100 → 200 showing healthy scaling.

**User Story:** As an Infrastructure Engineer at Ensemble, I want to monitor OS threads, so that I can ensure the underlying host machines are healthy and not a bottleneck for our application.

---

**P99:** `histogram_quantile(0.99, sum(rate(metric_bucket[5m])) by (le))`
**Success %:** `(sum(rate(metric{status=~"2..|3.."}[5m])) / sum(rate(metric[5m]))) * 100`
**Log filter:** `{namespace="monitoring"} |~ "(?i)error"`
**Memory:** `metric_bytes / 1024 / 1024` (bytes→MiB)
**Top N:** `topk(5, metric)`

---

## Conclusion

I successfully deployed an end-to-end observability stack by:

### 1. Linking APIs
Connected GKE to Grafana Cloud's three APIs (Prometheus, Loki, Tempo) using Kubernetes Secrets for secure credential rotation.

### 2. Running the App
Deployed Grafana Alloy with:
- RBAC permissions (ClusterRole with `watch` for real-time discovery)
- Three pipelines (Prometheus scrape → Loki tail → OTLP receive)
- Environment variable injection from Secrets

### 3. Getting It Going
- Generated 2 traces/second via telemetrygen
- Generated 1,740 HTTP requests (cost: $0.006)
- Built dashboard with 18 panels using Grafana AI query generator

### Key Breakthroughs

**Breakthrough #1: Five-AI Orchestration Strategy**

I didn't rely on a single LLM. I strategically orchestrated **five AI tools**, each for specific tasks:

**AI Tool Arsenal:**
- **Perplexity:** Researching Grafana Cloud documentation, Alloy configuration examples, RBAC best practices
- **Gemini:** Troubleshooting YAML syntax errors, validating configuration patterns, generating alternative approaches
- **Claude Code:** Kubernetes YAML generation, security patterns (Secrets vs ConfigMaps), deployment troubleshooting
- **Comet AI Browser:** Navigating Grafana Cloud UI, extracting API endpoints, generating access tokens
- **Grafana AI Agent:** Generating PromQL/LogQL/TraceQL queries tailored to my specific metrics

**My workflow across five AIs:**
1. Perplexity: "What's the best way to configure Grafana Alloy for Kubernetes?" → Found official docs with pipeline examples
2. Gemini: "Validate this RBAC YAML for syntax errors" → Caught missing `apiVersion` field
3. Comet: "Find Prometheus, Loki, Tempo endpoints in Grafana Cloud" → Found all 3 URLs
4. Claude: "How do I securely implement these API keys?" → Kubernetes Secrets pattern
5. Gemini: "Is there an alternative to ClusterRole for pod discovery?" → Confirmed ClusterRole is correct approach
6. Grafana AI: "Show CPU usage per pod" → Generated `sum(rate(alloy_resources_cpu_seconds_total[5m])) by (instance)`
7. Grafana AI: "Filter logs for errors" → Generated `sum(rate({namespace="monitoring"} |~ "(?i)error" [1m]))`
8. Perplexity: "Explain histogram_quantile in PromQL" → Found detailed explanation with examples
9. Grafana AI: "Calculate P99 DNS latency" → Generated `histogram_quantile(0.99, sum(rate(...)) by (le))`

**Key insight:** Each AI has unique strengths. Perplexity excels at research, Gemini at validation, Claude at infrastructure-as-code, Comet at UI navigation, and Grafana AI at context-aware query generation. Using all five in combination was exponentially faster than any single tool.

**Breakthrough #2: Pipeline Delay Discovery**

When panels showed "No Data," I validated infrastructure step-by-step (pods running, local metrics exist, logs clean) before realizing the 5-10 minute WAL batching delay. Patience required.

**Breakthrough #3: Cost Control**

My prompt "Make sure traffic stops so I'm not charged!" resulted in Unix timestamp arithmetic (`END_TIME=$(($(date +%s) + 1800))`) creating a self-terminating 30-minute workload.

**Breakthrough #4: Unified Collection**

Alloy replaced three agents (Prometheus, Promtail, Tempo) with one container using pipeline architecture.

**Breakthrough #5: Query Language Distinctions**
- PromQL (Metrics): `sum(rate(metric[5m])) by (label)`
- LogQL (Logs): `{label="value"} |~ "(?i)regex"`
- TraceQL (Traces): `{} | select(field) | by(attribute)`

### Final Result

**One Distributed Tracing Dashboard with 18 panels:**
- 6 Metrics panels
- 6 Logs panels
- 6 Traces panels

**Complete observability coverage:** All three pillars (metrics, logs, traces) integrated and flowing from GKE to Grafana Cloud.

**Production practices:**
- ✅ **Five-AI orchestration** (Perplexity + Gemini + Claude + Comet + Grafana AI)
- ✅ Time-bounded workloads ($0.006 cost)
- ✅ Secrets management (credential rotation)
- ✅ RBAC least-privilege (read-only pod access)
- ✅ Pipeline validation (Loki write success rate)
- ✅ Methodical troubleshooting (infrastructure → local → logs → wait)

**Innovation highlight:** Most students use a single LLM. I orchestrated **five AI tools working together**:

1. **Perplexity:** Researched official documentation, found Alloy configuration examples, explained PromQL functions
2. **Gemini:** Validated YAML syntax, caught configuration errors, suggested alternative approaches
3. **Claude Code:** Generated Kubernetes infrastructure (RBAC, Secrets, Alloy deployment), security patterns
4. **Comet AI Browser:** Navigated Grafana Cloud UI, found all 3 API endpoints, generated access token
5. **Grafana AI Agent:** Generated all 20 dashboard queries (PromQL, LogQL, TraceQL) tailored to my metrics

**Why this matters:**
- Each AI has unique strengths (research vs validation vs infrastructure vs UI navigation vs query generation)
- Iterative workflow across tools (9 interactions shown above)
- Grafana AI was particularly fantastic—understood context like `alloy_resources_cpu_seconds_total` and generated production-ready queries instantly
- Perplexity was invaluable for finding official docs when Claude/Gemini provided outdated examples
- Gemini caught YAML errors before deployment, saving troubleshooting time
